    <p>I created this flyer when I was working with my friend on getting started with his musical performance
        class around UWB hub. We worked together, sat down, and decided who was going to do the promotion
        and who will put together the music albu, (list of songs to be played)</p>

        <p>The "Resilient Visions 2020 UWB" program flyer was one of the few flyers that was created and presented
            as a prototype to the program organizer and our instructor professor. Minda J. Martin. I had included details
            such as the logo of the festival at the top, and text telling people where they can submit there work to be showcased 
            during the festival. And included the organization that is sponsoring the event, AATV.

        <p>This was a color painting that I created using a fresh with coloring board and the colors that are sketched on this piece are 
            black, red, orange, and yellow. It was seemingly easy combing the colors together as no difficulty had seem to risen. I created 
            this because I absolutely love the radiant colors mixing together. And having to dive into loving and appreciating 
            the narutal colors of nature.
